        <img class="MeBaby" src="obrazky/MeBaby.JPG" alt="MeBaby">
        <p>I was born 3 weeks before the estimated date of birth....and I think that it was the very last time in my entire life I have arrived somewhere really in advance. Since then I always feel like I have got this "spare time" left and I usually arrive really on time, or five minutes after the deadline.</p>
        <p>I am trying to work it out, but hard to change your bad habbits and I do not want my husband to search for a new nick-name, cause today he calls me "Mme Last Minute".</p>

        <h2>Hello Boys</h2>
        <p>Having an older brother I haveI spent my childhood playing socker and grampring in the trees. I did not want to dress like a girl either. 
        <p>The final touch to my "boy-like" years added my dad, who took care of my hairstyle in those years.</p> <p>No surprise that when we entered some shop with my brother, everybody was saying "Hello Boys!".</p>

        <h2>Nomad Vibe</h2>
        <p>I have left my parents house at the age for 15, as I started a grammar school and I stayed in the boarding school the whole week. Since then I have never been home again for more than a weekend. I was travelling the Czech Republic and after anywhere I could go with my friends or family.</p>
        <p>I lived several month in Manchester and in Brussels and finaly I found my second home 8 years ago in France, Normandy. </p>

        <h2>Hobbies&Family</h2>
        <p>I love travelling, chilling with a good glass of wine or prosecco and enjoy delicious food, which is the benefit of living in France. Fortunatelly I like as well sport, so I do not mind to keep moving in order to get rid of consequences of my other hobbies</p>
        <p>My family and friends are the fuel of my life, I am always happy to go back to my country, to spent some nice time with my french family or to travel to meet my friends across Europe.</p>
